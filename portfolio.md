## Overview
Devs code, I write. Have been doing this for 3 years and don't want to stop. Mostly write for blockchain products and companies because I believe they will win. 

Can handle tech posts, code samples, API docs, guides, tutorials, UX copy. I also run a Hive witness node and build apps for blockchain communities, which is a nice bonus.

My recent projects are implemented via the `Docs-as-Code` methodology. Using this approach to documentation, I can receive and incorporate high-quality feedback from developers faster, as well as maintain the latest industry standards. 

For the last couple of years, I've been working remotely and prefer such a form of delivering value. It boosts productivity and helps to create a more exciting environment and individual lifestyle. The ultimate goal is work satisfaction, collaboration, and meaningful contribution. Work for work's sake is a dangerous path to choose.

You can find most of my work on Github:

## Projects

This is a list of my best work from companies I've worked with. It includes technical writing and front-end development samples. All of the files provided below are listed on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dmitrydao/dmitrydao.github.io/tree/master/assets/files/portfolio).

### Chainlink (2021)
[Chainlink](https://chain.link) is a decentralized oracle network that provides reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for complex smart contracts on any blockchain. Chainlink greatly expands smart contracts' capability by enabling access to real-world data, events, payments, and more without sacrificing the security and reliability guarantees inherent to blockchain technology.

### OMG Network (2020)
[OMG Network](https://omg.network) is a trustless, non-custodial, Layer-2 scaling solution for transferring value on Ethereum. Its products allow you to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on the blockchain.

As a part of the OMG Network team, I maintained React-based [dev portal](https://docs.omg.network) with Docs as Code methodology. I also implemented the Use Case Driven Approach to documentation and was a major contributor of technical spec for [The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff) that gained the highest rank from the Reddit team and community.

[Hive](https://hive.io) is an innovative and forward-looking decentralized blockchain and ecosystem designed to scale with the widespread adoption of the currency and platforms in mind. Hive is a community-based project that was forked from the [Steem blockchain](https://steem.com).

As a part of the community, I run a Hive validator node ([witness](https://peakd.com/witnesses)) to secure the network. The most significant contributions include the following apps:
- [Hive Apps DB](https://github.com/dmitrydao/hive-apps-explorer) - a blockchain explorer for Hive-based apps.
- [Hived Scan](https://github.com/dmitrydao/hivedscan) - budgeting and governance system for Hive, aka DAO.

### Paytomat (2017-2019)
[Paytomat](https://paytomat.com/en) is a set of blockchain software solutions that helps merchants accept cryptocurrencies in cafes, restaurants, beauty salons, etc. The core product integrates into existing point-of-sale systems or offers a standalone solution without purchasing additional hardware.

As a part of the Paytomat team, I helped increase audience engagement by creating technical posts, guides, and manuals. I also had a consultant role and demonstrated the company's products to hundreds of people in 9 countries (UAE, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Ukraine, etc.)
