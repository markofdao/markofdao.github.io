## Overview
Security is one of the most important aspects one has to take care of when dealing with blockchain and cryptocurrency services. Most of the scholars who start their play-to-earn or play-and-earn journey have never used crypto before and that’s exactly why they should pay even more attention to security measures.

### Why does security matter?

Security in blockchain gaming matters just as much as in real life. Here are a few reasons why:

Every blockchain game will have interaction with financial assets at some point. Even if the game is completely free, you will have the chance to collect or win in-game items that can be sold for real money. If you don’t know how to keep those assets safe and you’re not aware of the numerous scams that exist in crypto, you may lose all of them in a flash. Trust me, there’s nothing worse than losing everything you’ve earned just because you didn’t protect yourself enough.

The difference between traditional in-game assets and blockchain in-game assets is that the latter ones are stored in a separate wallet from your gaming account. For the first time in history, gaming companies don’t possess your in-game assets. They are truly yours. This means that if you lose access to your wallet or you’re hacked, all of your assets are gone. I hope blockchains will introduce some ways to restore funds even if you lost access to your seed phrase but right now it’s not technically feasible.
 
 Understanding the basic security measures will also help you to sleep well and not be afraid that your funds will be stolen when you’re awake. This will help to reduce stress and worry. You’ll be confident that your assets are safe and you can focus on improving your gaming skills.

You never know when you can save somebody’s funds. The vast majority of gamers will not have experience with crypto and blockchains but you will. Sharing your story or even this post can help thousands of people avoid the same mistakes as you already did.

Your practical knowledge will help identify potential threats or new phishing attacks. There’s nothing more powerful than knowing what to expect or at least always being cautious of various spam DMs.

Knowledge is power but practical security knowledge is your shield and your ultimate weapon.

## Best security practices

Below you can see an extensive list of best security practices that every scholar needs to follow. It’s a long one so take your time to digest it.

### 1. Online security practices

This is the biggest and the most important section of all so take your time to go through all of the points. Don’t skip or skim it. The security of your funds depends on knowledge of this info.

#### ✅ Don't click on ads 

Unfortunately, it’s very hard for Google to control all of the ads that are being deployed on their ads platform. That’s why there are dozens if not hundreds of crypto scam ads on the web. Stay away from them.

*Actions:*
- Install Adblock.
- Always double-check if the link is an ad.
- Bookmark all of the official websites that you use every day. Don’t type them in your search address, you could accidentally open a scam website.

#### ✅ Be careful with cold emails and SMSs

Always be careful with any cold emails you receive despite the industry. The majority of cold emails are scams in any case. Crypto cold emails are scams on steroids. Below there are a few examples of such emails.

This example demonstrates that a scammer registered special character in its email. It’s usually very hard to catch but it is possible.

This example sends an email with fake Ledger Live link. After a user installs it, a scammer can drain all of your funds when you sign one of the transactions on your hardware wallet.

*Actions:*
- Always verify that the received message is from an official email address of the company, service, or person.
- Never click on any links in cold emails.
- If you want to make things more professional, I’d recommend you mastering an email filtering system. Here’s an in-depth guide if you’re up for it.

#### ✅ Be careful of shady DMs in Discord, Telegram, Facebook, any other messaging app

There are tons of such scam giveaway tweets, DMs, Youtube ads, Facebook comments etc. It's all over the place and very hard to moderate and police them all. Ignore them all. If it's too good to be true, it probably is!

Here are a few examples of scam giveaways.

> Message: Send me X Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. I’ll double it.
>
> What it means: You’re sending crypto to the scammer. You will never get it back.

*Actions:*
- Turn off your DMs. This will eliminate 98% of the issues that you may encounter: phishing links, impostors, etc.

### 2. Password management security practices

#### ✅ Never reuse passwords

Using the same password exposes you to scenarios where hackers can gain access to multiple websites and services you signed up for. During the years there have been hundreds of accidents that may have leaked your password.

*Actions:*
- Visit Have I been pwned and enter your email to check if your password has been exposed. If this is the case, make sure to change passwords across all of the affected accounts.
- Do the same for all of your emails.

#### ✅ Use a password manager

There’s no way you can remember all of your passwords as each website needs a unique one. To resolve this problem use password managers like 1Password or LastPass. They generate long and strong passwords that you can access anytime from any device in a secure way. You’ll need to remember only the master password and the password manager will do the rest for you.

*Extra tips:*
- Your master password should be at least 12-15 characters long.
- You’ll have to use it every day so it’s important to have it in your head too. Don’t make it too complicated but make sure it has a few numbers or special symbols.
- If you want to store your password somewhere, store it in a secure place OFFLINE! Don’t keep it on your laptop, text or Excel file, phone, GoogleDrive/Dropbox, external hard drive (HDD/SSD), built-in Google or Apple password manager. A laptop can be hacked, files can be permanently deleted, a phone can be lost, GoogleDrive/Dropbox can be compromised, an external hard drive can become dead or corrupted, built-in password managers can be exposed, compromised, or hacked just like your Google or Apple account. Don’t store it in a safe as it’s too obvious. Be creative!

*Actions:*
- Install LastPass or 1Password. Store the master password in a safe OFFLINE place: home safe, safe deposit box in a bank.
- Move all of your passwords and important files into one of the recommended password managers.
- Remove all of your passwords from built-in Google or Apple password managers and all other places. You should not have passwords anywhere else except your password manager.

#### ✅ Use 2FA wherever you can 

Make a habit of enabling 2-factor authentication across all of the services that provide it. Use Authy or LastPass Authenticator apps. I don’t recommend Google Authenticator as it doesn’t have the ability to recover or securely back up 2FA codes. I’ve seen several people losing access to their accounts because they lost their phone and couldn’t get access to Google Authenticator. If you like Google too much, go for it but make sure to install the app on another device and disable multi-device.

*Actions:*
- Install Authy or LastPass Authenticator. Add it as the default 2FA option in security settings.
- Remove SMS-based 2FA on all of your services as it’s not secure. Receiving a code to another email is better than SMS. I know most of the banking services have SMS authentication only so you can’t really change that but please take care of the rest.

#### ✅ Switch to hardware-based 2FA if possible

If you have enough funds, consider buying one of the hardware-based 2FA devices such as Yubico, Google Titan, Thetis. Those help to upgrade your 2FA to a physical USD device that you will need to authenticate before logging in. This is considered the highest level of security measures.

It’s advised to have two devices like that: primary and backup. If you lose the first one, you’ll still have access to the backup one. In one of the companies I used to work you can’t use any service if you don’t have 2 devices. It’s a rule and security policy. I advise everyone to save up some cash and eventually move to such security measures. It is totally worth it.

*Actions:*
- Put extra cash every month to afford to buy two hardware-based 2FA devices.
- Buy them!
- Upgrade your 2FA across all of the services that support hardware-based 2FA.

### 3. Crypto wallet security practices

#### ✅ Use a separate browser or laptop for gaming

As a p2e gamer, you should have a separate browser that you use strictly for blockchain gaming. If you can afford it, use a separate clean laptop. The main reason is that you should eliminate any potential threat that your wallet might have. These include browser extensions, activity trackers, phishing websites, etc. Also, you could install some phishing updates or extensions into one of your browsers, which means all of your wallets will be compromised.

See, most extensions require excessive permissions and frequently collect your personal data. This is a big issue as the more data about you and your wallet activity is available, the easier it is to hack your wallet. You don’t want this to happen.

*Actions:*
- Install a separate browser (Brave, Chrome, Edge) to play blockchain games. Create a fresh Metamask account on it, don’t use it anywhere else. Don’t install any extension, login to any service or website that isn’t on your playing game list.
- If you like testing stuff, install the third browser and create a new wallet there. Make sure that your gaming wallet and your testing wallet are different. To clarify, they should have separate seed phrases. Thus, one browser - one seed phrase. Alternatively, you could use your daily browser for testing various blockchain services but make sure that this wallet doesn’t have many funds on it at any given point. So that even if it’s hacked, there’s nothing to take from it.

#### ✅ Use separate browser profiles

If you must use a Chrome extension, then separate out your Metamask extension to its own browser profile. You can create multiple profiles for all the different wallet extensions you need to use.

#### ✅ Don’t store your crypto on centralized exchanges

Even though centralized exchanges are the most common places to keep your crypto, they behave the same way as banks. Moving crypto to Binance, Coinbase, etc. is the same as depositing your cash into a bank account. When you funds are in the bank, these are not your funds. The same applies to crypto.

There are several reasons why such exchanges are not secure:
- They can be hacked
- Your funds can be frozen
- You give up a lot of your personal info via KYC

*Actions:*
- Move your funds from a crypto exchange to your cold or hot wallet

#### ✅ Use a crypto hardware wallet

If you plan to work with crypto in the long-term you must buy a crypto hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. These wallets don’t have access to the internet and their only function is to sign transactions. Your funds will always be at risk if you don’t have one.

If you need to connect your hardware wallet to the Metamask, you should do it in your gaming browser. Don’t do it in your testing or personal browser. Ideally, you should have a separate browser for hardware wallet operations.

Remember, a hardware wallet doesn’t store your crypto. Your crypto is stored on a given blockchain. All that a hardware wallet does is it gives you access to your public and private keys that you can use to sign transactions. That’s it.

*Extra tips:*
- Never give your hardware wallet to anyone, even your friends or relatives.
- Never show or send your seed/secret phrase. Even if somebody offers you $1M, don’t do it. If you have easy access to your phrase, you’re doing something wrong.
- Where to write down your seed phrase? If you can afford it, write it on indestructible metal. Here’s a set that you can purchase from Amazon. I know that not all countries have access to Amazon so please find the alternatives in your country. If you can’t afford it, write it on 2-3 pieces of paper and laminate those pieces. It’s not as secure but it’s better than having a paper version.
- How to store your seed phrase? Have at least 2 backups. Split each backup and store each piece of your seed phrase in multiple places. It's kinda like Lord Voldemort broke his soul into different pieces and put them in the Horcrux. Don’t store it in your safe, it’s too obvious if somebody wants to steal it from you physically. Never upload, send, store your seed phrase online or external device.
- Store most of the funds in your hardware wallet (also called a cold wallet). Keep small amounts in a hot wallet that is not connected to your hardware wallet. A hot wallet is any wallet that has exposure to the internet: mobile or desktop wallet, Metamask wallet, etc.
- Do all purchases in your hot wallet and only then move the assets to your hardware wallet. You’ll be surprised how many hacks have been done by simply purchasing NFTs or in-game assets on phishing websites from a hardware wallet directly.

*Actions:*
- Buy a crypto hardware wallet.
- Move your crypto funds there.
- Connect your hardware wallet to a gaming or preferably separate browser.

### 4. Smart contract security practices

#### ✅ Limit smart contract approvals

When you work with tokens on any EVM-compatible blockchain (Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc.), each transaction requires a token approval before it can be confirmed and sent to the network. This is a security measure that protects Dapp developers and allows the Dapp smart contract to validate the amount of tokens you possess.

Setting a spend limit prevents a smart contract to drain all your tokens (e.g. USDT) if the contract is malicious or has a backdoor. Therefore, always control what permission you give out.

Here’s an example of the wallet that gave permissions to spend an unlimited amount of USDC and WETH respectively.

*Actions:*
- Go to Ethereum Token Approval, revoke all of your approvals. Next time when you need to approve some token, click Edit on Permission and customize the spend limit to the amount of tokens that you want to send.

### 5. Laptop/PC security practices

#### ✅ Do regular antivirus checks

…

*Actions:*
- Install an antivirus if you don’t have one. Set up an automatic weekly scan.

#### ✅ Never download or open files from strangers

You never know which file will end up installing a keylogger. Don't open ZIP files from random strangers.

*Actions:*
- Configure your Windows laptop to always show the file extension.

#### ✅ Don't use public WiFi that has an unsecured connection

Your data will be sent in plain text form, which means anyone can read your passwords, login credentials, financial operations, and personal messages. If WiFi doesn't have a 🔐 sign near their network, it has an unsecured connection. If the WiFi network doesn't have a password, it has an unsecured connection. If the WiFi network has a login and password that you have to open in your browser, it has an unsecured connection.

*Actions:*
- Always double-check if the network is secured. Remember that 🔐 sign is mandatory. If you need to use the internet asap, use a mobile hotspot instead. Actually, you should prefer this method at all times in hotels, airports, internet cafes, and inexpensive public places.

#### ✅ Alway use VPN when doing crypto transactions
