## Background
NFT land becomes one of the most important asset classes within the Metaverse narrative. Different ecosystems are being formed and people want to participate in brand new blockchain economies and potentially capitalize on them in one way or another. While the prices of various land plots are growing, the UX behind their ownership and management keeps struggling. 

That's why I recently started researching potential candidates that can solve some of the most prominent problems. And I think I found a good project that fixes the majority of people's pain points.

## Heroes of Mavia. Intro
The project is called [Heroes of Mavia](https://www.mavia.com/) (HOM) and its positioned to be the first AAA Blockchain Base Builder Game. It has Clash of Clans vibes and I totally love it. The team is on point and their in-game economy looks sustainable enough to play this game for years, not weeks.

Being an NFT land junky, I couldn't ignore the fact that they are building a separate NFT marketplace so I kept digging and was quite impressed with what they are planning to release quite soon.

## Heroes of Mavia. Marketplace
There are several great things that this game introduces for the entire NFT land market. Let's go through them one by one as each of them plays a crucial role for gamers and other game participants (investors, managers, etc.)

### Intuitive land purchase
What frustrates me the most about the current state of the virtual land market is that most of the marketplaces are too generic. They sell other forms of NFTs along with virtual land. There are no context and property-dedicated features. I know that the industry is new and we'll have some improvements eventually but we need to discuss them earlier to make the progress even faster.

The way HOM will spice things up is that when you hover a mouse, you'll see a location preview of particular land that you want to purchase. Such a visual map helps the buyer to make better decisions because one can research that particular region for long-term or short-term opportunities, stay near friends, etc.

Most of the marketplaces literally have a screenshot of a square, which gives no added info or value to the person who is about to spend thousands of dollars. I mean look at this:

While holding a virtual land sounds cool in theory, it's worthless without extra utility. And looking at the below demo, I can clearly see that each land will have quite a list - from basic renting to upgrading buildings, troops, etc. - everyone will have so much fun.

### Advanced renting programs
Renting your land has become quite a trend in several blockchain games already. HOM innovates even in this area. What they realized is that there are multiple ways of how one can use their land plot, and it is beautiful.

#### Get rental fee on your land
The very basic way is to rent your land and get paid for the stated rental agreement time. This is similar to renting your property in real life and it means that won't have a chance to profit from battles and challenges that happen on your land. I think this is fair for such a model.

#### Earn a share from the partnership program
A second option to utilize your land is to offer it to partner and split the profits from battle rewards and other activities. This option is a lot more fun as it gives a chance to collect in-game currency that you or a player can use to upgrade the land. In theory, this is the best opportunity since your earning potential gradually increases and the player is incentivized to do that.

Note, you still keep the ownership of the land with this approach, which is great. HOM introduces "Base wrapping" technology for this so another bonus to their team in terms of innovation.

#### Earn from land staking
Lastly, it seems like you'll have an option to stake your land too. This sounds fantastic as I haven't seen this available in any game yet. If you look closer, you'll see that the staking program will give you free NFT mints of statues and various other collectibles that I bet you'll be able to rent out in the future.

### Upgradable land
I've already mentioned this above - your land will not remain the same as the game progresses. Once you earn in-game currency, you'll be able to upgrade your land headquarters and statue NFTs. Those will give additional bonuses to the land they are equipped on.

The upgrading capability is one of the most critical missing pieces in lots of games. Player NFTs and the land plots should support upgrades and leveling capabilities to behave similarly to traditional games. I understand there are certain technical issues to implement such functionality but if HOM can pull it off, the future is bright for blockchain gaming.

### Telegram notifications
This may seem like not a big deal but trust me it is. Notifications are quite important as you can track rental payments, the performance of the player you're partnered with, and so forth. I wish more games had this capability, even though I think more platforms should be considered: Discord, Slack, etc.

P.S. The land equivalent in HOM is called a base.
